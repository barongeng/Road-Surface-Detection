# Road-Surface-Detection

This implementation is to detect road surface and analyse its quality. To detect road surface properly, CNN based classification technique is used. This is a 2 or 3 class classification problem, depending whethr road edge is considered or not.

Dataset
Kitti road dataset is used in this work. Dataset can be downloaded from http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php.
MatConvNet framework is used for CNN.
